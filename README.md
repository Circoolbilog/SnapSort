SnapSort

SnapSort is an AI-driven image archiving application designed to handle large-scale image collections, automating the captioning process and enabling intuitive, searchable access to images. With SnapSort, users can organize, retrieve, and manage images through smart, descriptive captions generated by CLIP, making it ideal for anyone who needs to keep a massive image library searchable and organized.
Features

    Automated Captioning: Uses OpenAIâ€™s CLIP model to generate descriptions for images, automatically populating captions and embeddings in the database.
    Efficient Image Search: Supports keyword and embedding-based search to locate images by caption, content, or similarity.
    Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle thousands to millions of images, with organized storage in subfolders and a robust database setup.
    Batch Processing: Automatically checks for and captions new images periodically, keeping the database updated without manual input.
    User-Friendly Interface: A simple UI for uploading and searching images, with filters and sorting options.

Installation

To set up SnapSort locally:

    Clone the Repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snapsort.git
cd snapsort

Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

    Set Up Database:
        Configure PostgreSQL or MongoDB, or use the local SQLite database for small-scale testing.
        Run the database migration script if provided.

    Configure Environment Variables:
        Set up any environment variables for API keys, database configurations, etc., in a .env file.

Usage

    Running the Application:

    bash

    python app.py

    Adding Images:
        Add images to the specified storage folder. Run the captioning script to update captions in the database.
        Run batch scripts to caption new images periodically or set up an automated job.

    Search for Images:
        Use the UI to search by keywords or similar images.
        API routes for image retrieval and search are available for integration with other services.

Roadmap

Implement user authentication for secure access.
Integrate more AI models for enhanced captioning.
Add support for additional metadata fields (e.g., tags, geolocation).

    Improve frontend UI with advanced filters and image preview options.
